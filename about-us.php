            PanchKhapan Hydropower Pvt. Ltd has obtained the survey and study license of Lower HewaKhola-A Hydropower Project from the Department of Electricity Development (DoED), and then Ministry of Water Resources of Government of Nepal in 2015.<br/><p>After the completion of detailed feasibility study the company intends to implement this project. Lower HewaKhola-A Hydropower Project is located in Sankhuwasabha District of Koshi Zone in the Eastern Region of Nepal. The project site is only about 10 km north-west from Chainpur Bazaar located along the Koshi Highway.</p><p>The under utilization of this vast resources has been due to various reasons including lack of consistent policy mechanism and project selection criteria, lack of basic infrastructure facilities, lack of technical and financial strengths of the country etc. Still traditional source of energy such as fuel wood, agriculture residue and animal waste is playing major role (86%) of the total energy consumption of the country. Commercial energy sources like fossil fuel and electricity share remaining portion of the energy consumption, of which, electricity contributes about 1.2% of the total energy needs.</p>
